# Movement Demo
Simple Unreal Engine multiplayer game where you race against other players. The goal is to reach the last checkpoint before others. If playing solo, you can try to get a new high score (fastest time).

Goal of the project was to explore using custom character movement component in a multiplayer game.

All but Control Rig(and Anim) graph is implemented in C++, for easy code reading without needing to open the project in Unreal Editor.

# Features

- Sprinting, built into PhyWalking movement mode.
- Sliding, built into PhysWalking movement mode.
- Mantling, using root motion source.
- Wall running, custom movement mode.
- Client predicted, server authoritative, multiplayer ready.
- Procedural animation tweaking using Control Rig (Wall run, foot ik).

### Checkpoint system
- Checkpoint subsystem keeps track of players current and next checkpoints.
- Checkpoints are sorted by Z value in descending order, which means players start from highest checkpoint and they must reach the goal, which is the lowest checkpoint.
- Current and next checkpoint data is stored in CheckPointTrackerComponent.
- Players that drop of the track, are reset to last checkpoint.

### HUD / UI / Widgets
- Widgets are created for local player and for remote players.
- They show each players name, fastests time, last time and win count.
